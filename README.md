<h3>Stage 1: Intake</h3>

</p>

This is the stage when a new ticket is created. There are a couple of ways I can submit a ticket - either by filling out a form, like the one shown here, or by sending an email to a designated ticketing address. When I fill out the form, I provide my contact information, describe the topic/issue, and provide all the necessary details about the problem.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Stage 2: Assignment</h3>

<p>
Once I submit the ticket, it gets assigned to an IT professional. To ensure the ticket is handled properly, the severity level may be adjusted. In this particular case, I change the Priority to "Emergency," the SLA Plan to "SEV-A," and assign the ticket to the "System Administrators" department. I also assign it to "Jane Doe," who happens to be an administrator in this scenario.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Stage 3: Working the Issue</h3>

<p>
Now that the ticket has been assigned to the appropriate department and professionals, the IT staff can start working on finding a solution to the issue. Throughout the process, any changes or updates related to the ticket can be recorded in the Ticket Thread. This way, everyone involved can stay informed about the progress and effectively communicate with each other.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Stage 4: Resolution</h3>

<p>
Once the issue has been resolved, the ticket can be marked as closed. In the osTicket system, closed tickets are moved from the Open section to the Closed section during this stage. As an IT professional, it's crucial for me to know where to find closed tickets since they can provide valuable insights and solutions for similar open tickets in the future.
</p>
<br />
<p>
So those are the four stages of the ticket lifecycle! Tickets play a significant role in my work, whether I'm handling helpdesk queries, working on systems, networking, security, or cloud-related tasks. Therefore, it's essential for me to be familiar with how ticketing systems function and the lifecycle they follow.
